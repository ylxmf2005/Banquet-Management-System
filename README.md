## Introduction



## Demo

[Website](https://bms-frontend-oohkp5osq-ylxmf2005s-projects.vercel.app/login)

- Admin account: `bmsadmin@polyu.hk`
- Admin password: `2411project`



## Getting Started

This is a full-stack application with separated frontend and backend, which can be deployed independently.

### Backend

Make sure you have Gradle installed, recommended version: 8.11

#### Port Configuration

The backend server will run on port 2411 by default. To change the port:

- Navigate to `src/main/java/hk/polyu/comp/project2411/bms/service/RestAPIServer.java`
- Modify the port number in line: `Server server = new Server(2411);`

#### Database Configuration

The `SQLConnection` class at `src/main/java/hk/polyu/comp/project2411/bms/connection/SQLConnection.java` provides a ready-to-use Oracle database connection. By default, it connects to a pre-configured Oracle database server.

To use your own database server, modify these fields in the `SQLConnection` class:

```java:src/main/java/hk/polyu/comp/project2411/bms/connection/SQLConnection.java
private String url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@your_host:your_port:your_sid";
private String username = "your_username";
private String password = "your_password";
```

- For Oracle: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port:SID`
- For MySQL: `jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/database`
- For PostgreSQL: `jdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/database`

#### Start Server

**Start server**

Run in development mode:

```bash
gradle run
```

Or build and run the production JAR:
```bash
gradle build
java -jar build/libs/BMS.jar
```

#### Database Initialization/Reset

By default:

- The system automatically creates necessary database tables if they don't exist
- Existing database tables are preserved

To reset the database:

- Navigate to `src/main/java/hk/polyu/comp/project2411/bms/service/BMSMain.java`

- Set clearIfExists to true: `initDatabase(true);`
- Restart the server.

Note: Use `clearIfExists=true` with caution as it will delete all existing data.



### Frontend

#### API Endpoint Configuration

Make sure you have Node.js installed, recommended version: v23.3.0

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd bms_frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The frontend needs to know where to find the backend API. There are two ways to configure this:

1. Environment Variables (Recommended):

   - Development: Create `.env.local`:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:2411
     ```

   - Production: Set in Vercel dashboard or your hosting platform

2. Direct Configuration:

   - Edit `src/service/api.ts`:

     ```typescript
     baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:2411'
     ```

#### Start Server

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can access your frontend at http://localhost:3000.

Or you can build the production files and deploy it to a hosting service like Vercel:

```
npm run build
```

If an error occurs during the creation of a meal, the already created banquet and its associated meals will also be rolled back to maintain consistency.

#### 2. Menu

This button **is applicable to all column headers**. Simply hover your mouse over the desired column header to activate the button.

This button allows you to: 

- Sort in ascending or descending order.

- Set conditions and input values to filter data.

- Customize column visibility.

#### 3. Edit

It's similar to [Create New Banquet](#1-create-new-banquet).

Additional Note:

- If you change a banquet's status from available to unavailable, any existing registrations for that banquet will remain unaffected. Attendees already registered will not be automatically removed.
- It is not recommended to modify a dish name that attendees have already selected in their registrations. If you need to make such changes, ensure you notify the attendees to reselect their meal or update the registrations manually via the Registration Management Tab.

#### 4. Delete

Note: meals and registrations related to the banquet will also be deleted.

#### 5. Previous/Next Page
